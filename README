Installing sqlite3 on Windows (7):
-Download both the exe (command line shell) and DLL Libraries (ZIP archive 
with DLL and Sqlite library) from http://www.sqlite.org/download.html
-Extract to C:\Windows\system (change drive name if necessary)
-Add the above directory to your Path (adjusted for your drive name) 
environment variable (Right click My Computer, click "Advanced System 
Settings", then in the 'Advanced' tab click 'Environment Variables' at
the bottom.  Path will be listed as a system variable
-See if it worked by opening up a command prompt (cmd) and typing
'sqlite3'
-Read docs http://www.sqlite.org/docs.html for more help

-run sqlite using: sqlite3 <dbName>
-to create tables use: sqlite3 <dbName> < <sql file>
    -this means: sqlite3 coho.db < tables.sql 
-sqlite commands:
    -sqlite3 coho.db to load the database.  Creates 'coho.db' database
    if it doesn't exist, opens if it does
    -when in the command prompt for sqlite
    	  -.tables lists all tables
	  -pragma table_info(<tableName>) gets you the column info

Usage: 

-Create a new instance of the CoHoData object.  This makes a new connection
to the database
-CoHoData.add_record() takes a dictionary as an argument.  This dictionary
should have {'fieldName':<fieldValue> ... } for all relevant fields.
-add_record()'s dictionary needs the 'type' key - this is used to determine
stock, option and futures trades (will add some error checking later)
-'type can be 'stock', 'option', or 'future'
